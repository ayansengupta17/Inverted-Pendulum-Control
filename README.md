# Inverted-Pendulum-Control
Design of a linear Quadratic Regulator balance controller for the Inverted Pendulum. After manually initializing the pendulum in the upright vertical position, the balance controller moves the rotary arm to keep the pendulum in this upright position. Moreover it is capable of balancing itself, even if minor external disturbances are given.
